Front-End vs. Back-End web development
In general terms, front-end development is about everything that happens in the web browser. So it's about designing and building the final website that's gonna be visible to the user. and therefore the name front-end.
The front-end developer uses the basic technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which together form the front-end technology stack. Now, many modern front-end developers add more stuff to the front-end stack, like React or Angular or Vue or Redux or GraphQL.
Now moving on to the back-end, this part of web development is about everything that happens on the web server. So everything that is invisible to the final user and therefore the name back-end.
Since we're talking about the server site now, let's actually define what a server really is. Well a basic server is really just a computer that is connected to hte internet which, first, stores a website's files, like HTML, CSS, and images, and second, runs an HTTP server, that is capable of understanding URLs, requests, and also delivering responses.
Static vs Dynamic vs API
- static website(simple website) is when a developer uploads the final ready to be served files of a website onto the web server. These files usually contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and more. these are the exact files that the server will later send to the browser when the website is requested. The browser will then take these files and render them as they are. This means that there is no work done on the server. There is no back-end code, and there's also no application whatsoever running.
- dynamic website and sometimes the term web application, they are kind of the same thing. Usually, when people refer to web applications, they mean a dynamic website with some functionality like logging in, creating user profiles, searching for stuff, and things like that in general.
- API-powered website is actually quite similar to a dynamic website. So, both work dynamically. the big difference is that with an API, we only send the data to the browser, usually in the JSON data format, and not the entire website.
So, when building API-powered websites, there is always these two steps, building an API and then consuming the API on the client side. about the client side, this is where the website is then actually assembled by plugging the data that we receive into some sort of templates, usually using some fancy front-end framework, like React, Angular, or Vue. So, you see that when building an API-powered website, the building phase of the website kind of moved from the back end to the front end. Or we can also say it moved from the server to the client. That's why many times you will see dynamic websites being called server-side rendered. because they're actually built on the server. On the other hand, API-powered websites are often called client-side rendered.

- API-powered website is actually quite similar to a dynamic website. So, both work dynamically. the big difference is that with an API, we only send the data to the browser, usually in the JSON data format, and not the entire website.
So, when building API-powered websites, there is always these two steps, building an API and then consuming the API on the client side. about the client side, this is where the website is then actually assembled by plugging the data that we receive into some sort of templates, usually using some fancy front-end framework, like React, Angular, or Vue. So, you see that when building an API-powered website, the building phase of the website kind of moved from the back end to the front end. Or we can also say it moved from the server to the client. That's why many times you will see dynamic websites being called server-side rendered. because they're actually built on the server. On the other hand, API-powered websites are often called client-side rendered.
Front-End vs. Back-End web development
In general terms, front-end development is about everything that happens in the web browser. So it's about designing and building the final website that's gonna be visible to the user. and therefore the name front-end.
The front-end developer uses the basic technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which together form the front-end technology stack. Now, many modern front-end developers add more stuff to the front-end stack, like React or Angular or Vue or Redux or GraphQL.
Now moving on to the back-end, this part of web development is about everything that happens on the web server. So everything that is invisible to the final user and therefore the name back-end.
Since we're talking about the server site now, let's actually define what a server really is. Well a basic server is really just a computer that is connected to hte internet which, first, stores a website's files, like HTML, CSS, and images, and second, runs an HTTP server, that is capable of understanding URLs, requests, and also delivering responses.
Static vs Dynamic vs API
- static website(simple website) is when a developer uploads the final ready to be served files of a website onto the web server. These files usually contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and more. these are the exact files that the server will later send to the browser when the website is requested. The browser will then take these files and render them as they are. This means that there is no work done on the server. There is no back-end code, and there's also no application whatsoever running.

Now moving on to the back-end, this part of web development is about everything that happens on the web server. So everything that is invisible to the final user and therefore the name back-end.
Since we're talking about the server site now, let's actually define what a server really is. Well a basic server is really just a computer that is connected to hte internet which, first, stores a website's files, like HTML, CSS, and images, and second, runs an HTTP server, that is capable of understanding URLs, requests, and also delivering responses.
Static vs Dynamic vs API
- static website(simple website) is when a developer uploads the final ready to be served files of a website onto the web server. These files usually contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and more. these are the exact files that the server will later send to the browser when the website is requested. The browser will then take these files and render them as they are. This means that there is no work done on the server. There is no back-end code, and there's also no application whatsoever running.
- dynamic website and sometimes the term web application, they are kind of the same thing. Usually, when people refer to web applications, they mean a dynamic website with some functionality like logging in, creating user profiles, searching for stuff, and things like that in general.
- API-powered website is actually quite similar to a dynamic website. So, both work dynamically. the big difference is that with an API, we only send the data to the browser, usually in the JSON data format, and not the entire website.
So, when building API-powered websites, there is always these two steps, building an API and then consuming the API on the client side. about the client side, this is where the website is then actually assembled by plugging the data that we receive into some sort of templates, usually using some fancy front-end framework, like React, Angular, or Vue. So, you see that when building an API-powered website, the building phase of the website kind of moved from the back end to the front end. Or we can also say it moved from the server to the client. That's why many times you will see dynamic websites being called server-side rendered. because they're actually built on the server. On the other hand, API-powered websites are often called client-side rendered.

So, when building API-powered websites, there is always these two steps, building an API and then consuming the API on the client side. about the client side, this is where the website is then actually assembled by plugging the data that we receive into some sort of templates, usually using some fancy front-end framework, like React, Angular, or Vue. So, you see that when building an API-powered website, the building phase of the website kind of moved from the back end to the front end. Or we can also say it moved from the server to the client. That's why many times you will see dynamic websites being called server-side rendered. because they're actually built on the server. On the other hand, API-powered websites are often called client-side rendered.
Front-End vs. Back-End web development
In general terms, front-end development is about everything that happens in the web browser. So it's about designing and building the final website that's gonna be visible to the user. and therefore the name front-end.
The front-end developer uses the basic technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which together form the front-end technology stack. Now, many modern front-end developers add more stuff to the front-end stack, like React or Angular or Vue or Redux or GraphQL.
Now moving on to the back-end, this part of web development is about everything that happens on the web server. So everything that is invisible to the final user and therefore the name back-end.
Since we're talking about the server site now, let's actually define what a server really is. Well a basic server is really just a computer that is connected to hte internet which, first, stores a website's files, like HTML, CSS, and images, and second, runs an HTTP server, that is capable of understanding URLs, requests, and also delivering responses.
Static vs Dynamic vs API
- static website(simple website) is when a developer uploads the final ready to be served files of a website onto the web server. These files usually contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and more. these are the exact files that the server will later send to the browser when the website is requested. The browser will then take these files and render them as they are. This means that there is no work done on the server. There is no back-end code, and there's also no application whatsoever running.
- dynamic website and sometimes the term web application, they are kind of the same thing. Usually, when people refer to web applications, they mean a dynamic website with some functionality like logging in, creating user profiles, searching for stuff, and things like that in general.

Since we're talking about the server site now, let's actually define what a server really is. Well a basic server is really just a computer that is connected to hte internet which, first, stores a website's files, like HTML, CSS, and images, and second, runs an HTTP server, that is capable of understanding URLs, requests, and also delivering responses.
Static vs Dynamic vs API
- static website(simple website) is when a developer uploads the final ready to be served files of a website onto the web server. These files usually contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and more. these are the exact files that the server will later send to the browser when the website is requested. The browser will then take these files and render them as they are. This means that there is no work done on the server. There is no back-end code, and there's also no application whatsoever running.
- dynamic website and sometimes the term web application, they are kind of the same thing. Usually, when people refer to web applications, they mean a dynamic website with some functionality like logging in, creating user profiles, searching for stuff, and things like that in general.
- API-powered website is actually quite similar to a dynamic website. So, both work dynamically. the big difference is that with an API, we only send the data to the browser, usually in the JSON data format, and not the entire website.
So, when building API-powered websites, there is always these two steps, building an API and then consuming the API on the client side. about the client side, this is where the website is then actually assembled by plugging the data that we receive into some sort of templates, usually using some fancy front-end framework, like React, Angular, or Vue. So, you see that when building an API-powered website, the building phase of the website kind of moved from the back end to the front end. Or we can also say it moved from the server to the client. That's why many times you will see dynamic websites being called server-side rendered. because they're actually built on the server. On the other hand, API-powered websites are often called client-side rendered.
Front-End vs. Back-End web development
In general terms, front-end development is about everything that happens in the web browser. So it's about designing and building the final website that's gonna be visible to the user. and therefore the name front-end.

So, when building API-powered websites, there is always these two steps, building an API and then consuming the API on the client side. about the client side, this is where the website is then actually assembled by plugging the data that we receive into some sort of templates, usually using some fancy front-end framework, like React, Angular, or Vue. So, you see that when building an API-powered website, the building phase of the website kind of moved from the back end to the front end. Or we can also say it moved from the server to the client. That's why many times you will see dynamic websites being called server-side rendered. because they're actually built on the server. On the other hand, API-powered websites are often called client-side rendered.
Front-End vs. Back-End web development
In general terms, front-end development is about everything that happens in the web browser. So it's about designing and building the final website that's gonna be visible to the user. and therefore the name front-end.
The front-end developer uses the basic technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which together form the front-end technology stack. Now, many modern front-end developers add more stuff to the front-end stack, like React or Angular or Vue or Redux or GraphQL.
Now moving on to the back-end, this part of web development is about everything that happens on the web server. So everything that is invisible to the final user and therefore the name back-end.
Since we're talking about the server site now, let's actually define what a server really is. Well a basic server is really just a computer that is connected to hte internet which, first, stores a website's files, like HTML, CSS, and images, and second, runs an HTTP server, that is capable of understanding URLs, requests, and also delivering responses.
Static vs Dynamic vs API
- static website(simple website) is when a developer uploads the final ready to be served files of a website onto the web server. These files usually contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and more. these are the exact files that the server will later send to the browser when the website is requested. The browser will then take these files and render them as they are. This means that there is no work done on the server. There is no back-end code, and there's also no application whatsoever running.
- dynamic website and sometimes the term web application, they are kind of the same thing. Usually, when people refer to web applications, they mean a dynamic website with some functionality like logging in, creating user profiles, searching for stuff, and things like that in general.

Since we're talking about the server site now, let's actually define what a server really is. Well a basic server is really just a computer that is connected to hte internet which, first, stores a website's files, like HTML, CSS, and images, and second, runs an HTTP server, that is capable of understanding URLs, requests, and also delivering responses.
Static vs Dynamic vs API
- static website(simple website) is when a developer uploads the final ready to be served files of a website onto the web server. These files usually contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and more. these are the exact files that the server will later send to the browser when the website is requested. The browser will then take these files and render them as they are. This means that there is no work done on the server. There is no back-end code, and there's also no application whatsoever running.
- dynamic website and sometimes the term web application, they are kind of the same thing. Usually, when people refer to web applications, they mean a dynamic website with some functionality like logging in, creating user profiles, searching for stuff, and things like that in general.
- API-powered website is actually quite similar to a dynamic website. So, both work dynamically. the big difference is that with an API, we only send the data to the browser, usually in the JSON data format, and not the entire website.
So, when building API-powered websites, there is always these two steps, building an API and then consuming the API on the client side. about the client side, this is where the website is then actually assembled by plugging the data that we receive into some sort of templates, usually using some fancy front-end framework, like React, Angular, or Vue. So, you see that when building an API-powered website, the building phase of the website kind of moved from the back end to the front end. Or we can also say it moved from the server to the client. That's why many times you will see dynamic websites being called server-side rendered. because they're actually built on the server. On the other hand, API-powered websites are often called client-side rendered.
Front-End vs. Back-End web development
In general terms, front-end development is about everything that happens in the web browser. So it's about designing and building the final website that's gonna be visible to the user. and therefore the name front-end.

So, when building API-powered websites, there is always these two steps, building an API and then consuming the API on the client side. about the client side, this is where the website is then actually assembled by plugging the data that we receive into some sort of templates, usually using some fancy front-end framework, like React, Angular, or Vue. So, you see that when building an API-powered website, the building phase of the website kind of moved from the back end to the front end. Or we can also say it moved from the server to the client. That's why many times you will see dynamic websites being called server-side rendered. because they're actually built on the server. On the other hand, API-powered websites are often called client-side rendered.
Front-End vs. Back-End web development
In general terms, front-end development is about everything that happens in the web browser. So it's about designing and building the final website that's gonna be visible to the user. and therefore the name front-end.
The front-end developer uses the basic technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which together form the front-end technology stack. Now, many modern front-end developers add more stuff to the front-end stack, like React or Angular or Vue or Redux or GraphQL.
Now moving on to the back-end, this part of web development is about everything that happens on the web server. So everything that is invisible to the final user and therefore the name back-end.
Since we're talking about the server site now, let's actually define what a server really is. Well a basic server is really just a computer that is connected to hte internet which, first, stores a website's files, like HTML, CSS, and images, and second, runs an HTTP server, that is capable of understanding URLs, requests, and also delivering responses.
Static vs Dynamic vs API
- static website(simple website) is when a developer uploads the final ready to be served files of a website onto the web server. These files usually contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and more. these are the exact files that the server will later send to the browser when the website is requested. The browser will then take these files and render them as they are. This means that there is no work done on the server. There is no back-end code, and there's also no application whatsoever running.
- dynamic website and sometimes the term web application, they are kind of the same thing. Usually, when people refer to web applications, they mean a dynamic website with some functionality like logging in, creating user profiles, searching for stuff, and things like that in general.
